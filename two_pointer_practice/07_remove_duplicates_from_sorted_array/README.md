# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Problem
Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

## Approach
Use two pointers: one to scan (`i`), another to keep track of unique elements (`j`).

## Complexity
Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
