# Container With Most Water

## Problem
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai), n vertical lines are drawn. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

## Approach
Use two-pointer from both ends and move inward, calculating area.

## Complexity
Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
